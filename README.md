# Digidentity-Test-Mobile-Application



## Key Features
### Architecture
MVP Pattern: The application is structured using the MVP pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The integration of a router component facilitates smooth navigation and enhances maintainability.
### User Interface
UIKit: The user interface is built using UIKit, which is particularly well-suited for creating complex interfaces. This choice ensures a high degree of flexibility and control over the UI elements.
### Asynchronous Programming
Async/Await: The application leverages the modern async/await approach for asynchronous programming. This enhances performance, improves readability, and simplifies error handling in asynchronous operations.
### Testing
Unit Tests: Several classes within the application are covered with unit tests. These tests serve as examples to ensure the reliability and robustness of the code, facilitating easier maintenance and future development. The protocols mocks are generated using Sourecery tool.
